Generate `LaTeX` math equations from `C` source code.

`CTex` is the tool to simplify documentation generation for source code with a lot of math expressions.  

`CTex` can help you in the following ways:  

* Quickly generates `LaTeX` equations for huge amount of math expressions in a source code.  
* Helps with representation of math formula in `LaTeX` format if you don't familiar with syntax.
* Generates `Doxygen`-friendly output

`CTex` is developed under macOS, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on Windows and  on a variety of Unix flavors as well.

## Contributing

There are plenty of possible improvements ([Check for open issues](https://github.com/galarius/ctex/issues)):

* Expansion of support for `LaTeX` syntax.  

* Generation of prettier output.  

* Test coverage.  

Here's a quick guide on `pull requests`:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/galarius/ctex/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.  
2. [Fork](https://github.com/galarius/ctex.git) this repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
3. Check out the README for information about the project setup and usage.
3. Push the change (it's recommended to use a separate branch for your feature).
4. Open a pull request.
5. I will try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from me after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
