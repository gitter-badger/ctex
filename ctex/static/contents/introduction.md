`CTex` is the tool to simplify documentation generation for source code with a lot of math expressions.  

`CTex` can help you in the following ways:  

* Quickly generates `LaTeX` equations for huge amount of math expressions in a source code.  
* Helps with representation of math formula in `LaTeX` format if you don't familiar with syntax.
* Generates `Doxygen`-friendly output

`CTex` is developed under macOS, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on Windows and  on a variety of Unix flavors as well.
